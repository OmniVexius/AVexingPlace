# AVexingPlace
The world is a Vexing place, is it not?
Ignore the hello_world, this is the core of my project, I want to learn to code so I can make tailor made games and stories for my kids.
I appreciate any help with getting started, currently running Unity 2017, best I can do on this machine, Im afraid.
